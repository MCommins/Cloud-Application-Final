# Cloud Application Final
 Final project created for CS 493: Cloud Application Development. 
 Permission to display this project to the public has been given by Nauman Chaudry Ph.D., Instructor of Computer Science at Oregon State University.
 
 This project displays knowledge of how to implement RESTful design principles using Node.js. The focus of the project is to show knowledge of pagination, authentication, and modeling entity relationships. As such, the application is purely utilitarian, and there has been no attempt to make it "look nice" with CSS, Bootstrap, etc.
 
 The application is hosted on Google Cloud and can be tested with the given Postman environment and collection. [Visiting the application](http://comminsfinal.appspot.com) will present a page that will redirect the user to the Google authentication page. Authenticating with Google will bring the user to a page that displays the JWT generated that allows the application to access user information. Input this JWT into the "token" variable of the Postman environment to make API calls with proper authentication.
